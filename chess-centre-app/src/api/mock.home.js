      question: "Do I need to be a member to join an event?",
      answer:
        "Our members get first pick on our upcoming events. Our venue is relatively small so we may not have capacity to offer entry to non-members.",

      question: "Can I just turn up to for a casual game?",

      question: "Will my games be FIDE rated?",
      answer:
        "Not initially, this requires a registered FIDE Arbiter to officiate the games. We do plan to visit this in the near future to provide more to our members.",
